I specialize in frontend development with expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Next.js, focusing on building efficient, user-friendly, and visually appealing interfaces. My experience includes working with Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, and TypeScript, ensuring clean and maintainable code.

With a strong foundation in Git and version control, I am committed to delivering high-quality, scalable solutions. I am driven by a passion for innovation and problem-solving in frontend development.
